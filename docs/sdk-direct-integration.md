# OwnID Compose Android SDK - Direct Integration

The OwnID Android SDK is a client library offering a secure and passwordless login alternative for your Android applications. It leverages [Passkeys](https://www.passkeys.com) to replace conventional passwords, fostering enhanced authentication methods.

This document describes the way to directly integrate and use OwnID Compose Android SDK with your identity platform. The alternative way is [Custom Integration](sdk-custom-integration.md).

For more general information about OwnID SDKs, see [OwnID Android SDK](../README.md).

## Before You Begin

Before incorporating OwnID into your Android app, you need to create an OwnID application in [OwnID Console](https://console.ownid.com) and integrate it with your identity platform. For details, see [OwnID documentation](https://docs.ownid.com/introduction).

## Add Dependency to Gradle File

The OwnID Compose Android SDK is available from the Maven Central repository. As long as your app's `build.gradle` file includes `mavenCentral()` as a repository, you can include the OwnID SDK by adding the following to the Gradle file (the latest version is: [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.ownid.android-sdk/compose?label=Compose%20Android%20SDK)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.ownid.android-sdk/compose)):

```groovy
implementation "com.ownid.android-sdk:compose:<latest version>"
```

The OwnID Compose Android SDK is built with Android API version 35 and Java 8+, and supports the minimum API version 23.

## Enable Java 8 Compatibility in Your Project

The OwnID SDK requires [Java 8 bytecode](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support). To enable this feature, add the following to your Gradle file:

```groovy
android {
   compileOptions {
      sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
      targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
   }
   kotlinOptions {
      jvmTarget = "1.8"
   }
}
```

## Enable Passkey authentication

The OwnID SDK uses [Passkeys](https://www.passkeys.com) to authenticate users. To enable passkey support for your Android app, you need to:

1. Set the Android package name and signing certificate SHA-256 hash for your OwnID application in the [OwnID Console](https://console.ownid.com) in the Integration > Native Apps section.
2. Associate your application with a website that your application owns using [Digital Asset Links](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links) by following this guide: [Add support for Digital Asset Links](https://developer.android.com/training/sign-in/passkeys#add-support-dal).

To obtain the SHA-256 hash of your Android app's signing certificate, use the keytool utility from the Java Development Kit (JDK). Run the following command in a terminal, replacing `[keystore_path]` and `[key_alias]` with your actual keystore path and key alias:
```
keytool -list -v -keystore [keystore_path] -alias [key_alias]
```
You may be prompted for the keystore and key passwords.

## Create Configuration File

The OwnID SDK uses a configuration file in your `assets` folder to configure itself. At a minimum, this JSON configuration file defines the OwnID App Id - the unique identifier of your OwnID application, which you can obtain from the [OwnID Console](https://console.ownid.com). Create `assets/ownIdIntegrationSdkConfig.json` and define the `appId` parameter:
```json
{
   "appId": "gephu342dnff2v" // Replace with your App Id
}
```

For additional configuration options, including logging and UI language, see [Advanced Configuration](sdk-advanced-configuration.md).

## Create OwnID Instance

Before adding OwnID UI to your app screens, you need to use an Android Context and configuration file to create an instance of OwnID. Product name used in networks calls as part of `User Agent` string:

See [complete example](../demo/integration-direct/src/main/java/com/ownid/demo/custom/DemoApp.kt)

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
   override fun onCreate() {
      super.onCreate()

      OwnId.createInstanceFromFile(
          context = applicationContext,
          configurationAssetFileName = "ownIdIntegrationSdkConfig.json",
          productName = "DirectIntegration/3.4.0"
        ) 
   }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The OwnID SDK automatically reads the `ownIdIntegrationSdkConfig.json` configuration file from your `assets` folder and creates an instance that is accessible as `OwnId.getInstanceOrThrow(OwnId.DEFAULT_INSTANCE_NAME)` or a short version `OwnId.getInstanceOrThrow()`. For details about additional customization see [Creating custom OwnID Instance](#creating-custom-ownid-instance).

## OwnID variants

OwnID SDK offers two variants:
   + **Boost** - designed to enhance your existing login and registration forms by adding OwnID widget as an add-on.
   + **Elite** - provides predefined authentication screens that can be easily customized with your brandâ€™s look and feel.

You can choose to integrate either or both.

## Implement the Registration Screen

Using the OwnID Compose SDK to implement passwordless authentication starts by adding an `OwnIdRegisterButton` component to your Registration screen. Your app then waits while the user interacts with OwnID.

```kotlin
OwnIdRegisterButton(
    loginId = emailValue,
    onResponse = { response -> 
        when (response.payload.type) { 
            OwnIdPayload.Type.Registration -> { 
                if (response.loginId.isNotBlank()) {
                    // (Optional) Set the actual login id that was used in OwnID flow into your registration UI
                }

                // 1. Collect any additional registration data from the user.
                // 2. On the Create Account button click, register the user with your identity platform and 
                //    set OwnId Data (response.payload.data) to the user's profile.
            }

            OwnIdPayload.Type.Login -> { 
                // Login the user with your identity platform using data from this event (response.payload.data).
            }
        }
    },
    onError = { error -> /* Handle 'error' according to your application flow. */ }
)
```

![OwnIdButton UI Example](button_view_example.png) ![OwnIdButton Dark UI Example](button_view_example_dark.png)

`OwnIdRegisterButton` component wraps `OwnIdButton` and has the following parameters:
   * `loginId` - Current user login id (e.g., email or phone number).
   * `modifier` - (optional) The modifier to be applied to the `OwnIdRegisterButton`.
   * `ownIdRegisterViewModel` - (optional) An instance of `OwnIdRegisterViewModel`.
   * `onReadyToRegister` - (optional) A function called when the user successfully completes OwnID registration flow.

For direct integration the functions `onResponse`, `onError`, `onUndo`, and `onBusy` will be called.

For additional UI customization, see [Button UI customization](sdk-advanced-configuration.md#button-ui-customization).

## Implement the Login Screen

Similar to the Registration screen, add the passwordless authentication to your application's Login screen by including one of OwnID button variants:

1. Side-by-side button: The `OwnIdButton` that is located on the side of the password input field.
2. Password replacing button: The `OwnIdAuthButton` that replaces password input field.

You can use any of this buttons based on your requirements. 

1. **Side-by-side button**

    Add the following to your Login screen's layout file:

    ```kotlin
    OwnIdLoginButton(
        loginIdProvider = { emailValue },
        onResponse = { response -> 
            // Login user with your identity platform using data from response (response.payload.data)
        },
        onError = { error -> /* Handle 'error' according to your application flow. */ }

<summary><b>Elite</b></summary>

## Run Elite

To implement passwordless authentication using the Elite in OwnID SDK, follow these three steps:

1. Create providers.
1. Start the Elite with event handlers.

### Create Providers

Providers manage critical components such as session handling and authentication mechanisms, including traditional password-based logins. They allow developers to define how users are authenticated, how sessions are maintained and how accounts are managed within the application. All providers use `suspend` functions.

You can define such providers:
1. **Session Provider**: Manages user session creation.
1. **Account Provider**: Handles account creation.
1. **Authentication Provider**: Manages various authentication mechanisms.
    1. Password-based authentication provider.

```kotlin
OwnId.providers {
    session { // Session Provider
        create { loginId: String, session: String, authToken: String, authMethod: AuthMethod? ->
            // Create a user session using the provided data and return an AuthResult indicating success or failure.
        }
    }

    account { // Account Provider
        register { loginId: String, profile: String, ownIdData: String?, authToken: String? ->
            // Register a new account with the given loginId and profile data. 
            // Set ownIdData to the user profile if available.
            // Return an AuthResult indicating the outcome of the registration.
        }
    }

    auth {
        password { // Password-based Authentication Provider
            authenticate { loginId: String, password: String ->
                // Authenticate the user with the provided loginId and password. 
                // Return an AuthResult to indicate success or failure. 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See [complete example](../demo/integration-direct/src/main/java/com/ownid/demo/custom/DemoApp.kt#L46)

### Start the Elite

To start a Elite, call the `start()` function. You can define event handlers for specific actions and responses within the authentication flow. They allow to customize behavior when specific events occur. All event handlers are optional.

```kotlin
OwnId.start {
    events { // All event handlers are optional.
        onNativeAction { name, params ->
            // Called when a native action is requested by other event handlers, such as `onAccountNotFound`.
            // Elite UI is currently closed or will be closed in a moment.
            // Run native actions such as user registration.
        }
        onAccountNotFound { loginId, ownIdData, authToken ->
            // Called when the specified account details do not match any existing accounts.
            // Use it to customize the flow if no account is found.
            // It should return a PageAction to define the next steps in the flow.
            PageAction.<...>
        }
        onFinish { loginId, authMethod, authToken ->
            // Called when the authentication flow successfully completes.
            // Elite UI is currently closed or will be closed in a moment.
            // Define post-authentication actions here, such as session management or navigation.
        }
        onError { cause ->
            // Called when an error occurs during the authentication flow.
            // Elite UI is currently closed or will be closed in a moment.
            // Handle errors gracefully, such as logging or showing a message to the user.
        }
        onClose {
            // Called when the authentication flow is closed, either by the user or automatically.
            // Elite UI is currently closed or will be closed in a moment.
            // Define any cleanup or UI updates needed.
        }
    }
}
```

See [complete example](../demo/integration-direct/src/main/java/com/ownid/demo/custom/screen/auth/AuthViewModel.kt#L123)

You can pass additional optional parameters to configure Elite WebView.

```kotlin
OwnId.start(
    options = EliteOptions(
        webView = EliteOptions.WebView(
            baseUrl = "https://mysite.com", // Optional base URL for the WebView content
            html = "<html></html>"          // Optional HTML content to be rendered in the WebView
        )
    )
) {
    events { }
}
```

**Page Actions**

OwnID SDK provides two Page Actions to control the next steps in the Elite flow:

1. `PageAction.Close` - In response to this action the `onClose` event handler will be called.
2. `PageAction.Native.Register(loginId, ownIdData, authToken)` - In response to this action the `onNativeAction` event handler will be called with the action name "register" and parameters containing the `loginId`, `ownIdData`, and `authToken` encoded as a JSON string.

## Sign in with Google

The "Sign in with Google" feature allows users to sign in with their Google account.

To trigger "Sign in with Google", create an instance of `OwnIdSocialViewModel` and call the `startSignInWithGoogle` method:

```kotlin
val context = LocalContext.current
val ownIdSocialViewModel = ownIdViewModel<OwnIdSocialViewModel>()

SignInWithGoogleButton( // Can be any UI
    onClick = { ownIdSocialViewModel.startSignInWithGoogle(context) },
)
```
To get the result of last `startSignInWithGoogle` method call use `socialResultFlow`:

```kotlin
val result = ownIdSocialViewModel.socialResultFlow.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
LaunchedEffect(result.value) {
    val state = result.value

    // Successful login
    if (state is OwnIdSocialViewModel.State.LoggedIn) {
        state.accessToken    // The OwnID access token
        state.sessionPayload // Optional Identity Platform payload
    }    

    // Failed login
    if (state is OwnIdSocialViewModel.State.Error) {
        state.cause // The underlying error
    }
}
```

## Credential enrollment

The credential enrollment feature enables users to enroll credentials outside of the login/registration flows. You can trigger credential enrollment on demand, such as after the user registers with a password.

To trigger credential enrollment, create an instance of `OwnIdEnrollmentViewModel` and call the `enrollCredential` method:

```kotlin
val context = LocalContext.current
val ownIdEnrollmentViewModel = ownIdViewModel<OwnIdEnrollmentViewModel>()

ownIdEnrollmentViewModel.enrollCredential(
    context = context,
    loginIdProvider = ...,
    authTokenProvider = ...
)
```

The `enrollCredential` method requires `loginIdProvider` and `authTokenProvider` functions:
 - `loginIdProvider`: A function that provides the user's login ID. This function should invoke the provided `OwnIdCallback<String>` with the login ID.
 - `authTokenProvider`: A function that provides the user's authentication token. It should invoke the provided `OwnIdCallback<String>` with the authentication token.

```kotlin
/**
 * Type alias for OwnID SDK callback.
 * Called when operation completed with a [Result] value.
 * **Important:** Always called on Main thread.
 */
public typealias OwnIdCallback<T> = Result<T>.() -> Unit
```` 

Optionally, to monitor the status of the last credential enrollment request, you can listen to enrollment events from the StateFlow via `OwnIdEnrollmentViewModel.enrollmentResultFlow`:

```kotlin
ownIdViewModel.enrollmentResultFlow
    .filterNotNull()
    .onEach { Log.i("UserActivity", "enrollmentResult: $it") }
    .launchIn(lifecycleScope)
```

## Creating custom OwnID Instance

To create the OwnID instance you can use a function that reads a configuration file or use one that accepts a JSON string of configuration options directly. The following sections describe this process.

### Option 1: Using Configuration File

You can use the `OwnId.createInstanceFromFile` function to create an OwnID instance using a file with configuration options.

```kotlin
OwnId.createInstanceFromFile(
    context = context, // Android context
    configurationAssetFileName = "ownIdIntegrationSdkConfig.json", // JSON configuration file
    productName = "DirectIntegration/3.4.0" // Used in networks calls as part of `User Agent` string.
)
```

### Option 2: Using JSON String
You can use the `OwnId.createInstanceFromJson` function to create an OwnID instance using a JSON string with configuration options.

```kotlin
OwnId.createInstanceFromJson(
    context = context, // Android context
    configurationJson = """{"appId": "gephu342dnff2v"}""", // String with configuration in JSON format. Use your App Id
    productName = "DirectIntegration/3.4.0" // Used in networks calls as part of `User Agent` string.
)
```

## Error and Exception Handling

The OwnID SDK provides special classes that you can use to add error and exception handling to your application.

The general `OwnIdException` class represents top-level class for errors and exceptions that may happen in the flow of the OwnID SDK. Check its definition in code [OwnIdException](/sdk/core/src/main/java/com/ownid/sdk/exception/OwnIdException.kt):

In addition, the following classes are special exceptions that can occur in the flow of the OwnID SDK:
* `class OwnIdFlowCanceled(val step: String) : OwnIdException("User canceled OwnID ($step) flow.")` - Exception that occurs when user cancelled OwnID flow. Usually application can ignore this error.

* `class OwnIdUserError(val code: String, val userMessage: String, message: String, cause: Throwable? = null) : OwnIdException(message, cause)` - Error that is intended to be reported to end user. The `userMessage` string is localized based on [OwnID SDK language](sdk-advanced-configuration.md/#ownid-sdk-language) and can be used as an error message for user.
